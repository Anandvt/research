The L parser works kind of like lex, but doesn't support a lot of things, and it aims to be simple to parse and reason about.

The language is basically:


  spec: [preamble] '^----$' rules '^----$' [postamble]
  rules:
       | rules rule;
  rule: regex 

  preamble and postamble are copied verbatim, with no introspection.
